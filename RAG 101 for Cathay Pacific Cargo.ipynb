    "Cathay Cargo is gaining altitude post-pandemic and is optimistic for demand in 2024, explains Chris Bowden, head of cargo global partnerships at Cathay Pacific.\n",
    "\n",
    "2023 was a year that saw Cathay and its cargo division Cathay Cargo begin to build up volumes and capacity, plus announce a major freighter order.\n",
    "\n",
    "From 2020 to 2022, Cathay was shackled by pandemic containment measures, but 2023 was a year of recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We’ve recovered pretty quickly from a difficult base,” says Chris Bowden, head of cargo global partnerships at Cathay, speaking to Air Cargo News in November.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bowden experienced a baptism of fire when in February 2022 he took on his present role managing the global partnerships and marketing teams of Cathay Cargo and witnessed the rapidly changing challenges the cargo team faced.\n",
    "\n",
    "He began his career with Cathay in August 2018 as a country manager for Indonesia before moving to Hong Kong with his family in September 2020 when he was appointed head of planning and business improvement focusing on efficiency and customer care.\n",
    "\n",
    "What followed was another year of acute uncertainty for the business. Economic conditions toughened, inflation rose, and volumes decreased, while air cargo rates dropped and there was a shift back to seafreight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cathay, of course, faced extra challenges. While belly capacity started returning to the market for many airlines in 2022, Cathay’s passenger flights, which account for 50% of its capacity, continued to be impacted by government quarantine restrictions in the first half of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The restrictions in the first half of 2022 also put the breaks on the airline’s long-haul freighter operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandemic rules were relaxed in the second half of 2022, which saw the airline build back flights, particularly in the last quarter. Meanwhile, full freighter operations resumed in June.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The restrictions and the knock-on effect that (the pandemic) has had on the passenger business means that the capacity in the passenger bellies has come back a lot slower,” Bowden says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Peak perks\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in 2023, with restrictions lifted and borders in the Chinese Mainland reopened, Cathay rebuilt its network and volumes increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, in the first 11 months of 2023, tonnage increased by 19.5% compared with the same period for 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second half of the year exports, particularly e-commerce and consumer goods, helped boost volumes from September.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cathay Cargo has also seen a fourth-quarter peak, greatly helped by e-commerce business.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The big consumer markets are all impacted by the e-commerce trend,” Bowden points out. These markets include North America, Europe, Singapore, and Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We’ve been well impacted by the e-commerce boom, which has come on a lot quicker and bigger than we expected and that’s flowing through to the end of the year. We’re seeing quite a strong finish,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "The e-commerce boom is supported by production in southern China and consumption in North America in particular.\n",
    "\n",
    "“This plays very well into Cathay’s geographical positioning with Hong Kong as the world’s largest airfreight hub,” Bowden points out.\n",
    "\n",
    "But 2023 wasn’t without issues. Revenues declined due to the weak market, which also saw rates decline. Nonetheless, increased capacity specifically within Cathay is a positive for the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "“By the end of 2024 we’re targeting for our cargo capacity to be back to what it was pre-Covid,” says Bowden.\n",
    "\n",
    "And Cathay Cargo does expect sustained demand in 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We’re seeing lots of opportunities, including transpacific and intra-Asia,” he explains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cathay believes that demand for e-commerce will persist throughout 2024, and that this, coupled with demand for traditional cargo means “2024 demand will be an increase on 2023”, says Bowden.\n",
    "\n",
    "He adds: “[For 2024], generally, we’re confident. The comparison point is with pre-Covid. And compared to 2019, we see 2024 as a better year.”\n",
    "\n",
    "What and where’s driving business?\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s not just e-commerce that’s driving growth. Cathay Cargo’s pharma, fresh food, mail products and specialist outsize shipments are also important, says Bowden.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, fresh produce from South America into Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland is a big growth area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interline partnerships mean that South America is an important market for Cathay.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The market data on South America suggests that we are the biggest importer from South America into Hong Kong. But we don’t actually fly there.” says Bowden.\n",
    "\n",
    "A physical limitation on networks is the capabilities of freighters, meaning expansion through partnerships can fill the gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bowden, who studied Swahili and Development Studies at university and spent time living in Africa earlier in his career, also identifies the continent as having development opportunities for Cathay.\n",
    "\n",
    "“There is a gap in our network map. We fly to Johannesburg, and we have some partnerships that let us access Africa, but it’s underdeveloped compared to the rest of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The company’s focus remains on the gigantic opportunities of Hong Kong and the wider Greater Bay Area, but from a personal perspective over the next 20 years Africa offers great new potential. I can see it becoming increasingly important.”\n",
    "\n",
    "A350Fs to meet demand\n",
    "\n",
    "To help meet future demand, Cathay Cargo has ordered six Airbus A350 freighters, with the right to order 20 more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deal, worth around $2.7bn, will see deliveries of the freighters from 2027 until 2029.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a change in direction for the company, which, until the order was announced in December, had an all-Boeing cargo fleet – including six owned 747-400ERFs, and 14 747-8Fs.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We’re coming from a homogenous fleet of 747s, which has been the bread and butter of the cargo industry for so long,” says Bowden. “That’s what we know and the base that we work from. That said, we fly A350 passenger aircraft, so understand what these new freighter aircraft offer us and we are excited to welcome them to the fleet.”\n",

      "Based on the information provided in the article, Cathay Cargo is poised for a positive performance in 2024. Here are the key factors that support this forecast:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Recovery from Pandemic Impacts**: Cathay Cargo has already seen a significant recovery in 2023, with a 19.5% increase in tonnage compared to the same period in 2022. This recovery is expected to continue into 2024 as the company builds on the momentum gained in the latter half of 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **E-commerce Demand**: The article highlights a strong boost in volumes driven by e-commerce, particularly in major consumer markets such as North America, Europe, Singapore, and Australia. Cathay Cargo anticipates that the demand for e-commerce will persist throughout 2024, contributing to overall growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Increased Capacity**: Cathay Cargo is targeting to restore its cargo capacity to pre-COVID levels by the end of 2024. The addition of six Airbus A350 freighters, with the option for more, will enhance their operational capabilities and allow them to meet growing demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Diverse Growth Areas**: Beyond e-commerce, Cathay Cargo is also focusing on other growth areas such as pharmaceuticals, fresh food, and specialist shipments. The demand for fresh produce from South America into Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland is specifically noted as a significant growth opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Geographical Positioning**: Cathay's strategic location in Hong Kong, the world's largest airfreight hub, positions it well to capitalize on trade routes and demand from various regions, including the Greater Bay Area and potential growth in Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Optimistic Outlook**: Chris Bowden expresses confidence in the demand for 2024, stating that it is expected to be better than 2019 levels, which indicates a strong recovery and growth trajectory.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, considering the recovery trends, sustained demand in e-commerce, increased capacity, and strategic positioning, Cathay Cargo is likely to experience a robust performance in 2024, with expectations for growth compared to 2023 and a return to pre-pandemic levels of operation.\n"
